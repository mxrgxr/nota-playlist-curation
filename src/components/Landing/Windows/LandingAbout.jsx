            <br />
            For those who prefer a more hands-off approach, Nota offers guided curation. This feature allows you to select a few songs to seed your recommendations, and our intelligent algorithm will generate a list of tracks based on the audio features of your chosen songs. This way, you can create a playlist that is consistent with your existing tracks while still discovering new music.
